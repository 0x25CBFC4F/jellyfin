============

This is the source code for Media Browser Server.

Media Browser Server is a media cataloging and transcoding server built on top of other popular open source technologies such as service stack.

In order to facilitate api consumption, the server features built-in api documentation courtesy of service stack and swagger.

We also have full .net and javascript wrappers around the api.
